# TTS Article Generator - Example Configuration File
# ===================================================
# This file demonstrates all available configuration options for the
# TTS Article Generator system. Copy this file and modify it according
# to your needs.

# ============================================================================
# Basic Configuration (Required)
# ============================================================================

# Path to the input article text file
# The article will be split into sentences and converted to speech
# Supports UTF-8 encoding for Chinese and English text
input_article = "examples/article.txt"

# Directory where output files will be saved
# The system will create this directory if it doesn't exist
# Output includes: final audio file, final subtitle file, and segment files
output_dir = "output"

# Directory for cache files (optional, default: ".cache")
# Cache enables resume functionality - if generation is interrupted,
# the system can continue from where it left off
cache_dir = ".cache"

# Enable or disable caching (optional, default: true)
# Set to false to always regenerate all audio segments
enable_cache = true

# ============================================================================
# Article Splitting Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Maximum length of each sentence segment in characters (optional, default: 200)
# Longer sentences will be split at punctuation marks (commas, semicolons, etc.)
# Recommended range: 50-300 characters
# - Too short: May result in unnatural pauses
# - Too long: May exceed TTS model limits or sound rushed
max_sentence_length = 200

# ============================================================================
# F5-TTS Model Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Model name (optional, default: "F5-TTS")
# Available models:
# - "F5-TTS": Standard F5-TTS model
# - "F5TTS_Base": Base model variant
# Note: Model availability depends on your F5-TTS installation
model_name = "F5-TTS"

# Number of sampling steps (optional, default: 32)
# Higher values produce better quality but take longer
# Recommended range: 16-64
# - 16: Fast, lower quality
# - 32: Balanced (recommended)
# - 64: Slow, higher quality
nfe_step = 32

# CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) strength (optional, default: 2.0)
# Controls how closely the model follows the reference audio
# Recommended range: 1.0-3.0
# - Lower values: More variation, less similar to reference
# - Higher values: More similar to reference, less variation
cfg_strength = 2.0

# Global speech speed multiplier (optional, default: 1.0)
# Affects all voices unless overridden per-voice
# Recommended range: 0.5-2.0
# - 0.8: Slower, more deliberate
# - 1.0: Normal speed
# - 1.2: Faster, more energetic
speed = 1.0

# ============================================================================
# Voice Configuration (Required)
# ============================================================================
# At least one voice must be configured. The first voice is typically used
# as the default/main voice. You can define multiple voices for different
# characters or narration styles.
#
# Voice Markers in Article:
# Use [voice_name] in your article to switch between voices:
#   This uses the default voice.
#   [narrator]
#   This uses the narrator voice.
#   [character1]
#   This uses character1 voice.
#   [main]
#   Back to the main voice.

# Main/Default Voice (Required)
# This voice will be used for text without explicit voice markers
[voices.main]
# Path to the reference audio file (WAV format, required)
# The reference audio defines the voice characteristics (tone, pitch, style)
# Recommended: 3-10 seconds of clear speech
ref_audio = "examples/voices/main.wav"

# Reference text (optional, default: "")
# The text content of the reference audio
# If left empty, the system will attempt to auto-transcribe
# Providing accurate reference text improves quality
ref_text = ""

# Voice-specific speed multiplier (optional)
# If specified, overrides the global speed setting for this voice
# Uncomment to use:
# speed = 1.0

# ============================================================================
# Additional Voices (Optional)
# ============================================================================
# You can define as many additional voices as needed
# Each voice should have a unique name and reference audio

# Example: Narrator Voice
# Useful for descriptive passages or scene-setting
[voices.narrator]
ref_audio = "examples/voices/narrator.wav"
ref_text = "这是旁白的声音，用于叙述故事背景。"
speed = 0.9  # Slightly slower for clarity

# Example: Character Voice 1
# Useful for dialogue or character-specific content
[voices.character1]
ref_audio = "examples/voices/character1.wav"
ref_text = "你好，我是角色一。"
# speed = 1.1  # Slightly faster for energetic character

# Example: Character Voice 2
# Another character with different voice characteristics
[voices.character2]
ref_audio = "examples/voices/character2.wav"
ref_text = ""  # Auto-transcribe
# speed = 1.0

# ============================================================================
# Usage Notes
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. File Paths:
#    - Can be absolute or relative to the working directory
#    - Use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\) on Windows
#    - Example: "C:/Users/YourName/voices/main.wav" or "C:\\Users\\YourName\\voices\\main.wav"
#
# 2. Voice Reference Audio:
#    - Must be WAV format
#    - Recommended: 16kHz or 24kHz sample rate
#    - Should contain clear, high-quality speech
#    - Avoid background noise or music
#    - 3-10 seconds duration is ideal
#
# 3. Reference Text:
#    - Should match the audio content exactly
#    - Include punctuation for better results
#    - Can be left empty for auto-transcription
#    - Chinese and English text are both supported
#
# 4. Performance Tips:
#    - Lower nfe_step for faster generation (quality trade-off)
#    - Enable cache to resume interrupted generations
#    - Use shorter max_sentence_length for more granular control
#
# 5. Quality Tips:
#    - Use high-quality reference audio (clear, no noise)
#    - Provide accurate reference text when possible
#    - Adjust cfg_strength to balance similarity vs. variation
#    - Test different speed values to find the best pace
#
# 6. Command-Line Override:
#    - Most settings can be overridden via command-line arguments
#    - Command-line arguments take precedence over config file
#    - Example: --input article.txt --output my_output/
#
# ============================================================================
# Troubleshooting
# ============================================================================
#
# Problem: "Reference audio file not found"
# Solution: Check that the ref_audio path is correct and the file exists
#
# Problem: "At least one voice must be configured"
# Solution: Ensure you have defined at least one [voices.name] section
#
# Problem: Audio quality is poor
# Solution: Try increasing nfe_step, using better reference audio, or
#           adjusting cfg_strength
#
# Problem: Generation is too slow
# Solution: Decrease nfe_step, or check GPU availability
#
# Problem: Voice doesn't match reference
# Solution: Provide accurate ref_text, increase cfg_strength, or use
#           longer/clearer reference audio
